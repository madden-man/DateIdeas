# DateIdeas

Just a simple app with circles indicating different emotions that someone might be feelings - 'inspired' or 'playful'
or whatever. Based on the user's selection of a circle, DateIdeas pop up with an accept button and a reject button,
and the ideas come up based on the category until the user likes one of them or there are no more ideas.
