# DateIdeas

A fun Android app to bring up ideas for dates the user can go on! The home screen contains a selection of
circles indicating different emotions that someone might be feelings - 'inspired', 'playful',
and so on. Based on the user's selection of a circle, DateIdeas pop up with an accept button and a reject button,
and the ideas come up based on the category until the user likes one of them or there are no more ideas.

Developed purely for extracurricular learning and growth (specifically in Android and Java).
